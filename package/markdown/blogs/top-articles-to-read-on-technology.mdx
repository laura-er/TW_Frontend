Blog Content:
TechCrunch: Covers business tech, startups, and venture capital.TechCrunch is an online publication that covers business tech, including news about startup companies, venture capital, video games, and mobile apps. The site’s Crunchbase database provides financial information on many technology companies. As a trusted source of tech news, TechCrunch attracts millions of readers every month. More than half of the website’s audience reads its content on their mobile devices. This means that TechCrunch readers are genuine tech-news junkies who enjoy reading the behind-the-scenes story.

The Verge: Offers irreverent takes on consumer tech with solid investigative reporting.Among the many categories of content covered on VentureBeat are health tech, gaming, and artificial intelligence. For incisive coverage of these fields, read the latest articles from VentureBeat. It’s not just about technology, however; it also covers a variety of industries, including health care, commerce, education, and gaming.

VentureBeat: Focuses on technology, business, and pop culture.While a press release might seem like a good way to get your article published, there are some important points to remember when pitching for a feature. You first need to determine what area of technology you’re interested in and what sort of coverage you’d prefer to see. If you’re a technologist, a technology-related article that touches on health care, biotechnology, or artificial intelligence may not be the best fit.

Gizmodo: If you’re looking for technology news, a quick trip to Gizmodo’s top articles will give you a comprehensive overview of the latest gadgets and consumer electronics. Founded more than a decade ago, Gizmodo is part of the Gawker Media Group, which also publishes Lifehacker, Deadspin, and Jezebel.
