description: A New York-based lifestyle blog offering diverse content from fashion to parenting. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has asked a judge to impose a gag order on Trump in his New York campaign fraud case. The request is 331 pages long and includes examples of past threats that go all the way back to the Roger Stone case. He is asking that Trump not be allowed to talk about lawyers, court staff, witnesses, jurors, the judge, or the families of anybody involved in the case. The mere fact that jurors alone are in any danger whatsoever in any case involving Trump should prohibit him from being president.
quotes: “In a world where reality feels like satire, your morning brew might be the only thing that still makes sense — or not.”

Steve Bannon led a chant, “Trump won!” at CPAC after ranting about how the 2020 election was stolen and Biden isn’t president.

Kenneth Chesebro, the attorney who helped devise the fake electors plot and is one of the defendants in the Fulton County case, neglected to tell investigators that he had a fake Twitter account. The BadgerPandit posted aggressive conspiracy theories that undercut statements he made to prosecutors about his role in the scheme.

An active duty member of the US Air Force has died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC. His name was Aaron Bushnell and he was 25 years old. He did it because he would “no longer be complicit in genocide” and said that his suffering was minimal compared to that of Palestinians.

Today is the primary in Michigan. Palestinian congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is leading a protest vote against Biden for not stopping the war in Gaza. Biden is not the president of Israel.

Junior received a shipment of white powder at his house that he wasn’t expecting. He said it included a death threat. Hazmat crews showed up to check it out. It wasn’t lethal.
