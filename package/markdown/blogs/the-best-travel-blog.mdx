description: A compilation of top travel blogs offering diverse perspectives and insights. If you’re like me, then you already understand the importance of curating your social media and inbox to only include the best of the best when it comes to travel blogs and travel-related content.You have a busy life and other things to do, so while you may have the best of intentions when signing up for a newsletter, you can also easily find yourself inundated with advice and “hacks” that aren’t necessarily relevant to you.. 
quotes: “A good travel blog doesn’t just show you where to go — it speaks to the traveler you are.”

#### Why should I use (and support) travel blogs?
Travel blogs can be rich with highly in-depth travel and destination information that could prove very very helpful when it comes to dreaming about, planning, and executing travel.

These are great resources for a variety of audiences, from students to nomads, budget backpackers to travel agencies, and beyond.

Travel blogs didn’t used to be so popular. Let’s be honest. Even 5 to 10 years ago, if one of your friends told you they were going to start a blog, would you not respond with a tired groan?

At the end of the day, reading a good travel blog should feel like you’re getting advice from a personal friend who knows what you like and what you don’t.

#### How to Find the best travel blog to reference for your next trip
The best travel blogs shine on their own.

Nevertheless, if I’m going to tell you I’ve found the best of the best, I can’t pick and choose based on a gut feeling alone (though I definitely used that, too).

What’s the saying about teaching a man to fish (find the best travel blog for your personal needs) ? Sure, I can give you a list and send you on your merry way. But what will you take away beyond yet-another bookmark in your sea of 20,000 other travel blog links?
