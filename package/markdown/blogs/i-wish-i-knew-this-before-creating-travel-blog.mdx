description: Insights and lessons learned from starting a travel blog. Blogging is one of my passions. Since my early professional years, I’ve worked on developing websites on WordPress (I was working on Visual Composer at that time — a drag-and-drop website builder). I was Marketing Manager for a Marketing Agency and we were developing websites for customers, including the optimization for the search engines like Google, the SEO. In 2009, for Christmas, I received as a lifetime present a domain with my name. I was only posting about my ongoing projects, not wanting to make a fuss about it.
quotes: “You don’t just build a blog — you build a version of yourself, one post, one lesson, and one journey at a time.”

 In 2014, when I moved to Paris and started working in Luxury Fashion, I turned my blog into a Fashion Blog. I named it at that time, Fashionista in Paris. The first few years in Paris have been hard for me, working and studying for my MBA in Luxury Marketing. I did not have time to have a LIFE back then. After finishing my MBA, I got a new job as a Luxury Store Manager and started to travel to relax and skip the busy life in Paris.

Every month I took 4 days in a row and just went on a city break in a European city. Because it was mostly a last-minute booking, I did not always have friends available to travel with me. So I started going alone and soon discovered how amazing traveling Solo can be. It was not a thing back then to travel Solo and people were in shock the first time when they heard me traveling alone. But Solo Travel gained in popularity in the past years.

##### "SO THAT BEING SAID, HERE’S MY ULTIMATE GUIDE TO STARTING A SUCCESSFUL TRAVEL BLOG!"

Mobile Optimization: Ensuring your blog is mobile-friendly.

Design Tips: Choosing themes and layouts that enhance user experience.

##### "OPTIMIZE YOUR BLOG FOR DESKTOP AND MOBILE AT THE SAME TIME"

If you plan on launching a Travel Blog, you know how important it is to have the information on the go. This is why the mobile version of a blog is more visited than the desktop version. With this in mind, you need to make sure your blog is mobile-friendly.

Some themes propose a completely new version for your mobile or just the option of hiding some features from your mobile version and using them only for your mobile version.
