description: A blog is where you share your ideas, thoughts, experiences, opinions, etc. A technical blog is about technology and differs from fictional, life blogs and other categories. It is a channel for you to share your expertise in a selected domain or niche. Some examples of technical blogs include TechCrunch, Engadget etc. Blogging allows you to develop your writing skills. Any concept is best understood when it is learnt to teach it to someone else.
quotes: “The best way to master a concept is to teach it — and a technical blog is your open classroom.”

In today’s world, getting a blog ready is as easy as signing for a website like medium.com, wordpress.com, etc. These sites offer free and paid services. There are several site templates available with customization options. Getting something like myfirstsite.wordpress.com shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes to set up. You have to pick a name for your blog. It can be anything you want and can be related to what you want to write about. For example, I have a blog called expoundai.wordpress.com. This is a blog about artificial intelligence. Once this step is done, all you need to do is start writing content.

This is the main crux of blogging. Following are few steps that I use to write an article:

Decide a topic you want to write about e.g. How to do unit testing in Python. This title can be changed later on but the topic itself would be fixed at this stage.

Read about the topic, find a couple of good references and learn more about what you want to write.

##### Skill Development: Enhancing writing and technical understanding.

##### Knowledge Sharing: Building credibility and audience through shared expertise.
